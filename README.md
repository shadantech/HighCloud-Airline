## 🔄 Multi-Tool Implementation (Internship Project)

This project was built as part of my **Data Analytics Internship**, where I performed end-to-end analysis using multiple tools:

### ✅ Excel  
- Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed raw flight data  
- Built an **interactive Excel dashboard** for operational KPIs  
- Used Pivot Tables, Power Query, Slicers, Charts  
- ([Live Dashboard](https://github.com/shadantech/Airlines_Excel_Dashboard))


### ✅ SQL  
- Designed SQL scripts for data extraction & preparation  
- Performed joins, aggregations, and route performance queries  
- Generated datasets for visualization

### ✅ Tableau  
- Developed a **navigation-style Tableau dashboard**  
- Created KPI cards, maps, and trend analysis  
- Used Parameters & LOD expressions for deeper insights  

### ✅ Power BI (Final & Most Advanced Version)  
- Complete, professionally designed multi-page dashboard  
- Dynamic KPIs, advanced navigation, DAX measures  
- Final analysis & reporting delivered in Power BI  

This demonstrates the **same project executed across four tools**, showing versatility and tool proficiency.
