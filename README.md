# ✈️ HighCloud Airline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger trends using a dataset of **110,852 rows**, covering seasonality, route performance, airport traffic, and operational efficiency.  
The final output includes a **multi-page Power BI dashboard** with advanced navigation, drill-through, and DAX-driven insights.

## ⭐ STAR Method Breakdown

### **S — Situation**
The raw airline dataset had scattered information on passenger volumes, routes, operational metrics, and seasonal patterns. Leadership needed a clear, interactive analytical view to improve decision-making.

### **T — Task**
To clean, model, and analyze the dataset, and build a Power BI dashboard that reveals:
- Seasonal trends  
- High-performing routes  
- Load factor efficiency  
- Airport-level insights  

### **A — Action**
- Cleaned and transformed data using **Power Query** (handled missing values, standardized dates, removed duplicates).  
- Built a structured **data model** and created DAX measures (Passenger Trends, Route Contribution %, Load Factor %, YoY/QoQ metrics).  
- Designed a professional **multi-page dashboard** with:
  - Advanced navigation buttons  
  - Slicers & drill-through  
  - Custom visuals  
- Focused visuals on seasonality, route contribution, and operational efficiency.

### **R — Result**
- Identified **peak passenger months: July & December**.  
- Revealed that **top 20% routes contribute 61%+ of total volume**, supporting capacity planning.  
- Discovered **higher weekend load factor**, useful for scheduling optimization.  
- Delivered a dashboard that improved clarity, speed of analysis, and data-driven decision-making.
